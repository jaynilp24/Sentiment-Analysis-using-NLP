# Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP
Twitter is one of the most actively used social media platform, and it natural that is a warehouse of tons of data. In regards to Twitter, it contains most of its data in the form of text (tweets). Now, since tweets are essentially a source used by people to express opinions, it surely contains one of the most vital characteristics of language; sentiments. And thus, with this project, I try to analyse the positive and negative sentiments among a large pool of tweets.

Using Natural Language Processing, sentiments in text can be analysed. In this, I'll be using Naive Bayes Classification to classify the tweet as 'Positive' or 'Negative'. But before data, I'll be exploring the dataset and also plotting a WordCloud.
